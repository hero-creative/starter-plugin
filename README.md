# WordPress Plugin Starter Template

Welcome to the WordPress Plugin Starter Template, developed by Hero Creative for our agency work. This project is actively maintained by our team, and we have made it available for others to use as well. Our goal with this template is to create a modular and maintainable foundation for building WordPress plugins, while keeping the project as simple as possible.

## Features

- **Add_Action Handlers**: Stubs for managing WordPress add_action handlers are included, allowing you to quickly implement your desired functionality.
- **Unit Testing**: The template comes with testing stubs for PHPUnit, making it easy to write and execute unit tests for your plugin.

- **Composer for Dependency Management**: This template uses Composer to manage dependencies, streamlining the process of adding and updating packages.
- **Autoloading**: The Composer autoloader with PSR-4 support is included, simplifying the process of managing and loading classes.
- **PHP Namespacing**: This template uses PHP namespacing to organize and structure your code.
